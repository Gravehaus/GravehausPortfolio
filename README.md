# GraveHaus Portfolio. 
##Portfolio Update Three

In this assignment I will have redesigned and restructured a presentable portfolio that utilizes javascript/ html/ css aspects made with an attempt using Materialize instead of Bootstrap. Links to my first project and most accomplished/ refined homework assignments will be showcased as well.

There are links included that are pathways to my social media presence including Linkdin, Instagram, Spotify and Email respectively.

UPDATE:
The site is all contained on one page with all links active. The links in the Navbar will lead the user to a new layout page which I did not refine. It's presentable but I focused more on the landing page due to it containing all the elements without deviating to a new page.

I updated the landing page to include a responsive-video background now that I have learned how to via project two. Updated profile picture as well to something a tad more professional. Color scheme is similar but not Deus Ex themed as previously done. I'll likely change the background at a later date to reflect more of my interests but this will suffice for now. I removed a few superfluous sections and added padding between the sections left in.

I utilized Materialize over Bootstrap to assist me in becoming more well rounding in UX/ UI. Because much of Materialze has their javascript built in conjunction with their css, very little to no .js was used. 

Project two: VOONDERBAR! Is now live and loaded and linked apporpriately to the github and heroku page.
